                                    a sustainable career in a strong and viable industry. We design each of our
                                    programs with this in mind. We get input
                                    from employers who meet with our faculty, staff, and administration to
                                    improve
                                    existing programs and to help create
                                    new
                                    ones, depending on the how the economy and needs of industry are evolving.
                                    This
                                    means that the skills and knowledge

                                    gain when you earn an Associate in Specialized Business or an Associate in
                                    Specialized Technology degree from Laurel
                                    come directly from the people who do the hiring and who know what qualities
                                    make
                                    a reliable and valuable employee.

                                    Laurel Business Institute was established in 1985 to meet the employment and
                                    training needs of this community by
                                    preparing individuals for jobs that do and will exist. We offer a wide variety of
                                    specialized associate degree
                                    programs
                                    that correspond with employment needs of the regional business community. Each of
                                    our programs was developed
                                    with
                                    significant input from regional employers. In addition to continually updating our
                                    programs and developing new
                                    ones, we
                                    support our students by staying abreast of future employment trends and by
                                    developing our facilities in a way
                                    that
                                    supports their professional development.

                                    We firmly believe that third party certifications are important credentials
                                    recognized by employers nationally
                                    and
                                    internationally as a statement of an individual’s proficiency in a particular field.
                                    We have certifications
                                    available in
                                    many programs of study and students are able to sit for most of their exams at
                                    through our PearsonVUE testing
                                    center.
                                    Our students are required to take and successfully complete study-related
                                    internships or participate in clinical
                                    rotations that give them valuable work experience prior to graduation. These
                                    internships and clinical rotations
                                    – which
                                    feature an excellent opportunity for hands-on, practical experience – often lead to
                                    employment opportunities for
                                    our
                                    students and graduates.

                                    Since the days of Sears and West Penn Railways, both of which were housed in our
                                    buildings early in the last
                                    century,
                                    these two historic structures have evolved into what is today LBI. We have seen more
                                    than 2,500 graduates pass
                                    through
                                    our doors and many dreams realized. And, it is no accident that the school is housed
                                    in historical buildings.
                                    After all,
                                    we believe that capitalizing on the existing strengths of the region – its people,
                                    its brick and steel
                                    buildings, and
                                    its underlying resourcefulness – are the best way to generate positive energy and
                                    create successful career
                                    opportunities
                                    for our graduates.

                                    Laurel Technical Institute, with locations in Sharon and Meadville, PA, was founded
                                    in 1926 as the Shenango
                                    Valley
                                    School of Commerce. Its mission was to serve Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio
                                    by supplying well-trained and
                                    qualified employees to businesses in the region. In 1977, Richard and Patricia
                                    McMahon purchased the school and
                                    instituted several changes to improve the school’s standing and its ability to
                                    benefit students and employers.
                                    Among
                                    these changes were national accreditation, development of a financial aid
                                    department, and community involvement.
                                    They
                                    adopted the name Business Institute of Pennsylvania in 1996.

                                    On September 4, 2007, Christopher and Nancy Decker, founders of Laurel Business
                                    Institute in Uniontown, PA,
                                    purchased
                                    the Business Institute of Pennsylvania and began to operate under the name Laurel
                                    Technical Institute to better
                                    reflect
                                    the programs offered at the school. They quickly continued the work started by the
                                    McMahons and made significant
                                    improvements to facilities and programs. These included a new school in Sharon,
                                    expanded and renovated space in
                                    Meadville, equipment modernization, curriculum updates, several new programs, and
                                    additional student services.

                                    Our growing network of Laurel campuses are dedicated to providing career-focused
                                    education and professional

                                    the needs of the regional
                                    employer
